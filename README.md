##  Software Engineers Dillema

In the world of IT there's always a dillama on the best Algorithm to use. Developers aren't sphere of compitency isn't that intertwined with security more so cryptograpyh. Many developers while 
developing websites, systems or applications tend to use an  algorithm with a reputable reputation or one that the've used before or one that they're advised to use by advanced engineers.
Whichever the method used to select the algorithm, there's a dilemma on which is the most effecient and robust cryptography algorithm to be used. There's always a temptation by the developers 
to tweak the Implementation of an algorithm to make it faster, less power consumption (This matters much on a large scale production project where the team intends to lower down the maintainence 
cost). On the other hand cryptographers and cryptoanalysts undestand better the negative implications of such an endeavour. Engineers on the other hand might be aware of the resultant implications
of such an ordeal and choose to get all hands on deck to pick an algorithm. The issue with this approach is that they may unconciously shift a greater focus on the cryptography-security aspect of
the project ending up consuming more human and time resources than intended to attain the goal on mind due to the uncertainity of when the perfect algorithm will be acquired. 

Thanks to the cryptography community the best algorithms in terms of robustness (strength against attacks) have been upvoted based on their preformance against tests made by the community
considering that the algorithms are made public for security reviews. This handles to a large extent the dillema but on the security aspect majorly. Cryptographers aren't skilled  in the 
dynamics of system dojnevelopment or software engineering to advise to optimisation techniques
